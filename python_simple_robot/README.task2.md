In order to evaluate your automation skills, we ask you to solve the following
task. The task is solved as a Github Actions Workflow.

Take the artefact you have created in task 1, and automate

* installing dependencies (if at all needed)
* building your programme (if at all needed)
* running the unit tests on pushes to master, or when opening pull requests
* running the two input examples, and testing that your programme returns the correct output

# Data Platform Engineering interview

The tasks as a whole should be submitted within ~1 week.

We know that job and life don't stop for our interview,
so please try to time box your efforts.
We don't know how many hours you should timebox, but aim for minimizing the effort,
and submit a good enough output, while walking us through your wins and challenges.

We are interested in your journey, so keep and share a journey log.
We are NOT interested only in you reaching the destination.
Reaching the destination is an bonus <3 to you taking us on your journey.

Please reach out to <andrei.neculau@schibsted.com> with any questions you might have.
Feel equally free to fill in the dots yourself, and explain how you reasoned about things.
